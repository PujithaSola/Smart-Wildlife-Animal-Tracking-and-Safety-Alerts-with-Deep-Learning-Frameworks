# Smart Wildlife Animal Tracking and Safety Alerts

## üìå Project Overview

This project aims to minimize human-wildlife conflict by detecting and classifying wild animals in real-time using deep learning techniques. It combines object detection (YOLOv8n) with image classification (ResNet18) to provide alerts for potentially dangerous wildlife near human settlements.

The project uses datasets collected from Kaggle and web scraping tools, and applies augmentation techniques to improve the model generalization. The trained models produce real-time detections and classifications, accompanied by result metrics and visualizations.
